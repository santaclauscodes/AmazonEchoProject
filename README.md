# AmazonEchoProject
# I created this project as a first project which allows for a conversation with an Amazon Echo dot
# using C#

# The purpose was to setup a structure of all the amazon basic utterances and commands

# rather than a database, I have a list of facts about each kid (Isaac and Malachi)

# They were fairly young when I put together this program and they liked the idea that the Amazon echo dot seemed

# to know something about them.

# I have tried to carry this code forward so that it can work with the latest versions of Visual Studio, but something
# has changed in the underlying libraries. Still it was very fun to develop
